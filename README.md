# Multi-branch multiple-instance ordinal classification-based <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: yellow;">BreastAgeNet</span> identified deviated tissue ageing in high-risk breast tissues


**_BreastAgeNet_** is a computational model designed to assess tissue aging in histologically normal breast tissue (NBT) from whole slide images (WSIs). 
The framework leverages advanced deep learning methods, incorporating a multi-branch multiple-instance learning (MIL) architecture to capture subtle age-related alterations in breast tissue.

**_BreastAgeNet_** provides an ordinal classification of tissue aging into four distinct categories: <35 years, 35-45 years, 45-55 years, and >55 years.

**_BreastAgeNet's_** multi-head self-attentions across multiple branches enable a more nuanced understanding of age-related changes in NBT.

Moreover, **_BreastAgeNet_** generates attention heatmaps that reveal ageing-related heterogeneity across breast tissue, with this variability showing strong associations with manually annotated, age-related lobule types. 
This suggests the model's ability to pinpoint localized aging diversity, which can be important for understanding subtle variations in aging processes within the same breast.

With its substantiated ability to model aging trajectories in NBT, <i>BreastAgeNet</i> has revealed deviations between expected (chronological) and observed (predicted) tissue aging in high-risk NBT from _gBRCA1/2_ mutation carriers or breast cancer patients.

Taking it a step further, attention heatmaps can pinpoint tissue regions responsible for 'mismatched' tissue aging predictions. This approach opens the door to techniques like spatial transcriptomics, which could further elucidate molecular abnormalities at these sitesâ€”potentially identifying early indicators of cancer initiation.
