# Multi-branch multiple-instance ordinal classification-based _BreastAgeNet_ identified deviated tissue ageing in high-risk breast tissues


_BreastAgeNet_ is a computational model designed to assess tissue aging in histologically normal breast tissue (NBT) from whole slide images (WSIs).

The framework leverages advanced deep learning methods, incorporating a multi-branch multiple-instance learning (MIL) architecture to capture subtle age-related alterations in breast tissue.

It provides an ordinal classification of tissue aging into four distinct categories: <35 years, 35-45 years, 45-55 years, and >55 years.

This enables a more nuanced understanding of age-related changes in breast tissue by leveraging the attention mechanism across multiple branches

Moreover, _BreastAgeNet_ generates attention heatmaps that reveal ageing-related heterogeneity across breast tissue, with this variability showing strong associations with manually annotated, age-related lobule types. This suggests the model's ability to pinpoint localized aging diversity, which can be important for understanding subtle variations in aging processes within the same breast.

With its substantiated ability to model aging trajectories in NBT, _BreastAgeNet_ has revealed deviations between expected (chronological) and observed (predicted) tissue aging in high-risk NBT from _gBRCA1/2_ mutation carriers or breast cancer patients.

Taking it a step further, attention heatmaps can pinpoint tissue regions responsible for 'mismatched' tissue aging predictions. This approach opens the door to techniques like spatial transcriptomics, which could further elucidate molecular abnormalities at these sitesâ€”potentially identifying early indicators of cancer initiation.
