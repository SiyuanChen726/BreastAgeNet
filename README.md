# Multi-branch multiple-instance ordinal classification-based **_BreastAgeNet_** identified deviated tissue ageing in high-risk breast tissues


**_BreastAgeNet_** is a computational model designed to assess tissue ageing in histologically normal breast tissue (NBT) from whole slide images (WSIs). 
The framework leverages advanced deep learning methods, incorporating a multi-branch multiple-instance learning (MIL) architecture to capture subtle age-related histological alterations.

**_BreastAgeNet_** delivers an ordinal classification of tissue ageing, categorizing it into four distinct age ranges: <35 years, 35-45 years, 45-55 years, and >55 years.

**_BreastAgeNet's_** multi-head self-attentions across multiple branches enable a more nuanced understanding of age-related changes in NBT.

Moreover, **_BreastAgeNet_** provides attention heatmaps that can directly visualise ageing-related heterogeneity across the tissue, with this variability showing strong associations with manually annotated, age-related lobule types. 
This suggests the model's ability to pinpoint localized ageing diversity, which can be important for understanding varied ageing processes within the same breast.

With its substantiated ability to model ageing trajectories in NBT, <i>BreastAgeNet</i> has revealed deviations between expected (chronological) and observed (predicted) tissue ageing in high-risk NBT from _gBRCA1/2_ mutation carriers or breast cancer patients.

Taking it a step further, attention heatmaps can pinpoint tissue regions responsible for 'mismatched' tissue ageing predictions. This approach opens the door to techniques like spatial transcriptomics, which could further elucidate molecular abnormalities at these sitesâ€”potentially identifying early indicators of cancer initiation.
